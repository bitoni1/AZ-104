Deployment Slot Fundamentals
----------------------------
Powerful app service 

Certain plans have access to a # of extra environments

For example: My App is a production application 

A staging slot can be created, which replicates the same code, with a new DNS URL

This alows for testing before moving to production.

A swap button is available, which essentially swaps the DNS records, 
which is nice since there is no copy of code

Something to note: Code is running on same hardware even though different DNS

Performance testing against staging will also put prod under load 

Same app service = same hardware

Another thing to mention: These are seperate environments which can have 
independant  settings for each environment 

Production app and Staging app can have their own sql databases with their own
connection strings. These configurations are completed in the Azure Portal


For example: 
Environment Variables can be configured inside your code and inside of Azure Portal. 
This enables your code to reach out to azure for this information, instead of hardcoding it in source.

    - EV used to determine what environment the app is in (Prod vs Dev)
        - If Prod then pass Prod DB connection string
        - Else pass Dev DB connection string

These settings are known as sticky settings since they persist across swaps.

Things that are sticky:

General settings
Handler Mappings
Monitoring
Web Jobs 
App Settings 
DB Connection string

These can be configured to be non-sticky
