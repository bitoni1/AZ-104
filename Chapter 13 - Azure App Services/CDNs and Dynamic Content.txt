Dyamic Content in CDN
----------------------
Dynamic content when navigated to, is cached on edge server.

Whenever we go to refresh, we are now served cached data, not

the new items that are dynammic to the site

By default - CDNs ignore query strings

Settings must be configured to route to origin server through CDN network 
to realize the non-cached, dynamic content
